Sourceforge project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ck2toeu3/

REQUIREMENTS
----
CK2 version 1.0 or later
EU3:DW version 5.1 or later

INSTRUCTIONS
----

1) Find the desired save file in "[YOUR CK2 DIRECTORY]/save games".
2) Copy the save game in to the directory of this converter, and rename it to "input.ck2"
3) Open the file "configuration.txt".  In the file there is a line that reads 
	CK2directory = "D:\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II"
   Modify it so that it points to YOUR copy of Crusader Kings 2.
4) In "configuration.txt", there is a line that reads
	EU3directory = "D:\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis III"
   Modify it so that it points to YOUR copy of Europa Universalis III.
5) Run "CK2ToEU3.exe".  Currently, this does nothing, but eventually this will create a file in the converters directory called "output.eu3".
6) A file named log.txt will be created. Immediately report any errors to the thread on the forums.
